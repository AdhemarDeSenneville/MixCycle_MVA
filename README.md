# Work overview
As part of the class of E. BACRY on [Audio signal processing – Time-frequency analysis](https://www.master-mva.com/cours/audio-signal-processing-time-frequency-analysis/), I studied the paper **[MixCycle: Unsupervised Speech Separation via
Cyclic Mixture Permutation Invariant Training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.03875)** from Bogaziçi University. 
The paper introduce two unsupervised source separation
methods, which involve self-supervised training from singlechannel two-source speech mixtures.

The main contibrution of that repository is an implementation of all *Supervised* and *Unsupervised* technics seen in the paper. And an application to Speech denoizing and all the hypotesis relaxation that goes with that application.

# Delivrable 

- Report 
  - Part 1 describe and explain the paper
  - Part 2 present the experiments done 
- A presentation
- While not asked, the code is avalable in a single notbook. Be aware that the code is made to work on kaggle and using Weights and Biases API. That allows easy debugging and experimenting
